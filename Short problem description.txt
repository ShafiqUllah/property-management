Problem Description: Real Estate Management System

Overview:
Our software development project is focused on the creation of a Real Estate Management System that caters to the diverse needs of property owners, potential buyers, and administrators. The system will facilitate property posting, offer management, and user communication while maintaining robust data security.

Key Features:

Administrator's Dashboard:

The admin should have access to a central dashboard for efficiently managing users and overseeing property-related activities.
Owner Registration and Verification:

Property owners must register on the website.
Admin approval is required before owners can post properties.
Property Listing and Maintenance (CRUD):

Owners can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on their property listings.
Properties in the 'pending' status cannot be deleted.
Owner Offers and Interactions:

Owners are not allowed to submit offers on properties through the website.
Offer Handling:

Admin has the authority to accept or reject offers, ensuring a secure and transparent process.
Upon mutual acceptance during the 'pending' phase, property status transitions to 'contingent.'
Customers can initiate general inquiries with property owners (excluding official offers).
The 'contingency' status can be canceled.
A record of placed offers is maintained.
Customer Registration:

Customers can register as users on the platform.
Customers do not have the option to post properties.
Customer Actions:

Customers can review their offer history.
Maintain a list of their current offers.
Offers cannot be canceled once they reach the 'contingency' phase.
Offer receipts can be downloaded or printed in PDF or Excel formats.
Initiating an offer changes the property status to 'pending.'
Customers can engage in direct messaging with property owners.
Property bookmarks can be saved in a designated list.
General Functionality:

Robust user authentication with login/logout capabilities.
Implementation of JWT security measures to restrict unauthorized access to different pages.
Necessary process verifications, including email notifications for property purchases and in-app messaging.
Optional implementation of refresh tokens for enhanced user experience.
Data validation for user inputs is left as an optional feature.
Overall Objective:
The goal of this software development project is to craft a robust Real Estate Management System that caters to property owners, prospective buyers, and administrators. The system aims to streamline property management, facilitate offer negotiations, and enhance communication between users while upholding data security and user privacy.
